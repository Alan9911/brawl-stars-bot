# How to make the bot play the best
Bot will only be able to play and win some games at 300-400 trophy range! If your brawler is more trophies it will drop down to 300! The strategy is to lose a game, then play vs bots and win it and so on.

# Can you get banned?
Most likely no. There are similiar bots out there that are way more blatantly playing like a bot and are fine. There's always a small risk tho.

# PC detects it's a virus?

When an executable created with any tool that compiles Python code to an executable format is flagged as a virus by antivirus software, it is typically due to a phenomenon known as a "false positive." This can happen for several reasons:

Heuristic Analysis: Antivirus programs use heuristic analysis methods to detect patterns of behavior or code that resemble known malware. The way Nuitka compiles Python code into a binary could inadvertently match these patterns, especially if the resulting binary behaves in ways similar to malware (e.g., network communication, file manipulation).

Code Obfuscation and Packing: Compilers and packaging tools like Nuitka often obfuscate or pack the code to make the executable smaller or protect the source code. This obfuscation can resemble the techniques used by malware authors to hide malicious code, triggering antivirus warnings.

Shared Signatures: If malware has previously been compiled with the same tool and configuration, antivirus software might have flagged the entire signature of the compiled output as malicious. Consequently, other executables compiled in a similar manner could also be flagged.

Lack of Digital Signature: Executables that are not digitally signed, or are signed with an unrecognized or untrusted certificate, can be treated with suspicion by antivirus programs. Digital signatures help verify the authenticity and integrity of software.

Antivirus Database Updates: Sometimes, the issue is with the antivirus software itself. The database it uses to identify threats might not be up-to-date, or it might contain errors that lead to false positives.
